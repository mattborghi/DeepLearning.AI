# DeepLearningAI

## Course Notes [Spanish]

The Specialization consists in the following 5 courses:

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](./notes/course_one.pdf).

2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](./notes/course_two.pdf).

3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](./notes/course_three.pdf).

4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](./notes/course_four.pdf).

5. [Sequence Models](./notes/course_five.pdf).

> “we wrap up this sequence of courses as we wrap up this specialization I hope that you will find ways to use these ideas to further your career to pursue your dreams but perhaps most important to do whatever you think is the best work you can do our humanity the world today has challenges but with the power of a on power of deep learning I think we can make it a much better place and now that you have this superpower I hope you will use it to go out there and make life better for yourself but also for other people”. **Andrew Ng**.
