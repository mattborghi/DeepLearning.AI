# DeepLearningAI

I already completed the Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization.

In the future I should edit the docx file to have a better termination and, better, make a LaTeX version of it.

The Specialization consists in the following 5 courses:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.

3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects.

4. Convolutional Neural Networks.

5. Sequence Models.

I consider Neural Style Transfer, Self Driving Cars and Reinforcemente Learning (the latter not covered in the course) as the most interesting topics about AI, and the ones I would like to further investigate.

## Here I list some resources for implementing Machine Learning/Deep Learning projects.
